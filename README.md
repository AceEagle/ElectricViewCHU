ElectricViewCHU

ElectricViewChu is a software made to control, collect and process data from an tektronix (maybe others in the future) oscilloscope and AFG, that are connected to a DBD (Dielectric Barrier Discharge). The software will be able to show up to 6 graph in live as the data is collected. It's gonna let you be able to have the live Lissajous figure and others necessary graph for the experiment. There's gonna be a data processing page too, where you can process a little bit your data before exporting it outside of the app. 


Still on progress (Soon finished the GUI)
