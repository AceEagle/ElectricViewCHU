ElectricViewCHU

ElectricViewChu is a software made to control, collect and process data from an tektronix (maybe others in the future) oscilloscope and AFG, that are connected to a DBD (Dielectric Barrier Discharge). The software show 6 differents graphics in live as the data is collected. It's giving you the live Lissajous figure and others necessary graphs for the data processing. There's gonna be a data processing page too, where you can process a little bit your data before exporting it outside of the app.
